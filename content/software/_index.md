**Renormalizer** is a Python-based tensor network package with a
special focus on electron-vibration coupled quantum dynamics. It
was originally developed based on Matrix Product States (MPS)
and Matrix Product Operators (MPO), and thus the algorithms are
called (TD-)DMRG. In 2024, support for Tree Tensor Network
States (TTNS) and Tree Tensor Network Operators (TTNO) was
implemented. Renormalizer can routinely perform numerically
exact quantum dynamics simulations involving hundreds to
thousands of degrees of freedom. The major part of the package
was written by Jiajun Ren and Weitang Li when they were PhD
students in Prof. Zhigang Shuai's group. The package continues
to be developed and maintained through a collaboration between
the [Shuai](http://www.shuaigroup.net/index.php), Ren, and [Li](https://weitangligroup.com/) groups.
