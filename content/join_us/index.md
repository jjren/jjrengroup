We are currently seeking talented individuals at different
levels to join us in our exciting research endeavors. We are
committed to offer an inclusive training environment where
undegraduate, graduate students, post-docs, RAs, and other
members can grow into leaders in academia and industry.

## Postdocs 

We welcome postdoctoral researchers with expertise in:

- Quantum dynamics & non-equilibrium processes
- Quantum chemistry
- Tensor network / Matrix product state algorithms
- Quantum computing in chemistry 

**Requirements:** Ph.D. in chemistry, physics, materials, or related
fields; strong computational skills; proficiency in at least one
programming language.

## Ph.D. Students 
We are actively recruiting highly motivated and creative
students to join our Ph.D. program. Our group focuses on the
frontiers of theoretical and computational chemistry, and we
welcome aspiring students who are passionate about solving
complex scientific problems.

**Ideal Candidate:**
- A strong background (B.S. or M.S.) in Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science, or a related discipline.
- A genuine passion for fundamental research and computational problem-solving.
- Prior experience with quantum mechanics and programming (e.g., Python, C++, Fortran) is highly beneficial, but a strong desire to learn these skills is the most essential quality.

**Our Commitment:** We provide close mentorship and a
comprehensive training program designed to help you develop into
an independent, high-impact researcher. You will be encouraged
to publish first-author papers, present at conferences, and
build a strong foundation for your future career.

## Undergraduate Students 

We offer research opportunities for undergraduates to:
- Participate in computational projects
- Learn modern simulation techniques
- Acquire programming skills 

Curiosity, enthusiasm, and a willingness to learn are the key qualities we look for.

## How to Apply 
To apply for a position in our research group, please send your
CV, and any relevant documents to Dr. Ren (**Email:**
jjren@bnu.edu.cn). We look forward to hearing from you!
