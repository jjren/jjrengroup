        We are a theoretical chemistry team affiliated with
        [the Key Laboratory of Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry, Ministry of Education](http://www.chem.bnu.edu.cn/zdsys/llyjsghxjybzdsys/), led
        by [Prof. Wei-Hai Fang](http://www.chem.bnu.edu.cn/szll/lyys/121276.html). 
        Our team focuses on
        exploring novel time-dependent, non-equilibrium
        phenomena and dynamical properties of electronic
        excited states in complex molecular systems by
        developing state-of-the-art tensor network techniques
        and quantum algorithms. We also maintain close
        collaborations with other research teams within the Key
        Laboratory.
